A guid to compile tensorflow from source with avx2 on windows

This is a guid for compiling tensorflow from source with avx2 instruction set. 
I have uploaded the whl file, which I have compiled using this guid as proof of my own guid.
it took me 2 hours to prepare everything + 3 hours to compile.
I did this for benchmarking purposes. I want to benchmark the avx2 capability of cpus.
